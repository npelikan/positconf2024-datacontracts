# Reclaiming Your Weekend With Data Contracts!

This repository serves as supplement to the talk I delivered at posit:::conf 2024.

## Literate Data Contracts

You can find an example of a Literate Data contract at literate_contract.qmd. This is written in R, and uses the `pointblank` package, however you can use Python and Great Expectations as well!

### Collaborating
A great example of a collaborative data contract process can be found at the pull request [here](https://github.com/npelikan/positconf2024-datacontracts/pull/1)

## Helpful Links on Data Contracts:

[Driving Data Quality With Data Contracts Book](https://data-contracts.com/) -- this talk, and my thinking on Data Contracts, owes a huge debt to Andrew's work. I cannot recommend his work highly enough!
